# generate fields

The following source code is a test of mine to generate a content based on a struct for several types of content type
formats:

  1. JSON format.
  2. XML (with and without headers) format.
  3. url.Values (encoded) format.
  4. Multipart form data format.

The test is made to provide me some examples on doing so when I require the reference itself.
